# Cs-251-Project
This is our final project for the course Cs-251 

To run the server type the following command in the Project root terminal -> 
python3 manage.py runserver

Open your browser and connect to the web address ->
localhost:8000
(if not working , then copy the IP address from the terminal)

We have modules called apps that implement different functions. 
Whenever a new functionality has to be incorporated, we can transfer the flow of the website to another link using urlpatterns. 
This helps us organize and connect all the functions within the apps.
